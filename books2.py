Pydantic : It is a data library that is used for data modeling, data parsing and has efficient error handling.
It is commonly used as a resource for data validation and how to handle data coming to our FastAPI application.
Till now we were using Body() which has no data validation property, i.e. users can enter BookId as -900 and Rating as 99999 and still the system would accept it.
To put a check on this, we need Pydantic.
